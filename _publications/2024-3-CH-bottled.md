Non-tariff barriers remain key in explaining patterns of trade and their presence motivates many deep trade agreements. Their nature and welfare effects, however, remain poorly understood. We study how consumer prices and trade costs in the bottled water industry changed following the introduction of the Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA). Even though bottled water was not subject to new tariffs, we show that UK consumer prices of imported bottled water rose by 17% relative to consumer prices of the same products in continental Europe. We also find that road freight rates on routes with UK destinations rose by 30% relative to routes with destinations in the UK. Finally, we leverage an industry equilibrium model of the bottled water industry to quantify the contribution of the rise of freight rates to the rise in the final consumer prices of bottled water. Our findings highlight the role of changes in the price of complementary services facilitating goods trade as a source of non-tariff barriers.
