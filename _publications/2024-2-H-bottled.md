It is well known that substantial spatial price dispersion persists between countries of the European Single Market (ESM). Whether this spatial price dispersion simply reflects destination-specific marginal costs or is driven by non-trade-policy barriers that fragment European markets remains an open question. This paper leverages technological and institutional features of the European bottled water industry to estimate the level of non-trade-policy barriers and their effect on equilibrium price dispersion and consumer welfare. Using a partial equilibrium model of the bottled water industry, I estimate non-trade-policy barriers between European countries of the (ESM) that are equivalent to a 20% import tariff. Relative to an integrated benchmark economy, non-trade-policy barriers increase equilibrium international spatial price dispersion by 5% and reduce consumer welfare equivalent to a 10% tax on bottled water consumption.
