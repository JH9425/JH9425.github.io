Spatial price dispersion is commonplace but separating trading frictions from differences in primitive cost factors remains elusive. I leverage technological and institutional features of the European bottled water industry and study the effect of cross-border trading frictions on equilibrium price dispersion and consumer welfare. Using a partial equilibrium model of the bottled water industry, I estimate that cross-border frictions between European countries of the European Single Market amount to roughly a 20% tariff-equivalent. Relative to an integrated bench- mark economy, cross-border trading frictions increase international spatial price dispersion by 5% and are equivalent to a 10% tax on bottled water consumption.
